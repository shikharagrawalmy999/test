00:00:00,897 --> 00:00:03,802
<v ->Hello and welcome to the Complete Python Bootcamp.</v>

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,261
My name is Jose Portilla,

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:07,823
and I will be your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:09,312
I've taught thousands of students

5
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,973
on Udemy about data science,

6
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:12,865
and I'm excited to teach even more students

7
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,535
about the complete ins and outs

8
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,360
of the Python programming language.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,425
This course is designed to take you from zero

10
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:23,577
to hero in Python in an easy and fun fashion.

11
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,693
So why learn Python?

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,126
Python is one of the most useful

13
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,971
programming languages to know,

14
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,079
and in recent years,

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,889
skill demand for Python has exploded in the job market.

16
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,947
With this course, it's easy to learn

17
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:37,396
and it's a very powerful tool

18
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:41,225
for implementing your own ideas with Python.

19
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,380
So who is this course for?

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,453
This course is suitable for

21
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,904
beginners that have never programmed,

22
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,465
programmers coming in from another language,

23
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:50,488
and finally,

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,259
programmers who know the basics of Python syntax

25
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,014
but want to bring their knowledge to the next level

26
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:59,094
with the advanced topics presented in this course.

27
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,625
So, what's the course like?

28
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,194
We'll start off by getting Python up

29
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,529
and running on your computer,

30
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,393
regardless of your operating system.

31
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:09,222
Whether you're using Windows, Mac or Linux.

32
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:12,966
Then you'll get lifetime access to over 100 lectures,

33
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,834
discussing everything from basic Python syntax,

34
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:18,618
to the advanced topics and modules in Python.

35
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,703
Each lecture includes a video screencast

36
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,858
with clear concept explanations,

37
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,696
as well as entire notebooks filled with both code

38
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,243
and written explanations.

39
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:30,645
So you can learn in whatever way is best for you.

40
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,816
There's tests, quizzes, and homework assignments

41
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:36,466
all along the way to check your understanding.

42
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:39,232
This course is also project-based with milestone projects

43
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,272
where you will create games with Python,

44
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:44,790
including a final capstone project.

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,822
You'll also learn how to avoid commoner mistakes in Python,

46
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:50,120
and learn best programming practises,

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,464
such as code formatting and object-oriented programming.

48
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,979
Once you complete this course,

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,843
you'll feel extremely confident putting

50
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:00,770
Python programming on your resume.

51
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,530
More importantly, you'll learn to have

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,113
a lifelong love of programming,

53
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,267
and there's a 30 day money back guarantee.

54
