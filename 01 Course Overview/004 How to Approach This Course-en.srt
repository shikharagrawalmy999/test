00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:01,774
<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>

2
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:04,839
and welcome to the lecture, How to Approach This Course.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,240
This lecture will go over the basics

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,924
of how to get the most out of this course.

5
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:13,112
Now, people who are taking this course

6
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:16,008
hopefully fall within three categories.

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,852
Beginners who have never programmed before,

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,495
programmers coming in from another language,

9
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,599
or intermediate Python programmers.

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,256
Now I'm going to discuss how you should approach this

11
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:29,591
course depending on what category you're in.

12
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,536
First, beginners who have never programmed.

13
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:36,917
Complete beginners should read the notebooks

14
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,015
before watching the screen casts.

15
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:42,903
Then, watch the screen cast and follow along.

16
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,703
Then, you should take the quiz, or test,

17
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,864
or corresponding homework assignments

18
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,827
to check for your understanding.

19
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:52,741
Afterwards, make sure to review the written notebook

20
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,536
to make sure you full understood

21
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,453
the lecture's material.

22
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,219
Now, if you're a programmer coming in from another language,

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,024
you should read the lecture notebooks and follow along.

24
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,671
Then, if something isn't clear,

25
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,832
go ahead and watch the screen cast.

26
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:11,944
Afterwards, you should take the quiz, test,

27
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,478
or corresponding homework assignment

28
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:15,139
and make sure you can check your understanding

29
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,983
either through the screen cast

30
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,983
or through the notebook.

31
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:24,379
Finally, for intermediate Python programmers,

32
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,809
you should read the notebook

33
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:27,876
and make sure you know the topic.

34
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,466
If you're and intermediate Python programmer,

35
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,783
you can probably skip the first few sections

36
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:34,662
of the course where we discuss Python basics.

37
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,629
Once you're at the advanced topics,

38
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,486
I would recommend you read the notebooks

39
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,167
and watch the screen casts

40
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,005
to get the most out of this course.

41
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,594
And do the corresponding either test,

42
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,935
quiz, or homework assignment for that section

43
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,102
of the course.

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,582
Now, discussing questions.

45
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:54,774
If after watching the screen cast or checking the notebook

46
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:56,327
something doesn't make sense,

47
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,234
feel free to start a discussion in the forums.

48
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:00,709
Remember to check if there is a FAQ,

49
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,227
Frequently Asked Questions lecture

50
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,480
corresponding with the lecture.

51
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,959
As this course gets populated with more students,

52
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,247
more FAQ lectures will begin to pop up

53
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,644
throughout the course.

54
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:15,058
Also, remember to use the search feature

55
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:18,518
in the discussion section for faster results.

56
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,383
Alright, that's it for this section of the course.

57
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:24,021
Up next, we'll learn how to instal Python

58
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,203
on our computers, and go over the basic course environment.

59
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:31,018
Thank you, and I will see you at the next lecture.
