00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,506
and welcome to the course curriculum overview.

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:05,474
In this video,

4
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:07,016
we're gonna be getting a brief overview

5
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:09,466
of all the content in this course.

6
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:12,049
Let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,018
First, this course starts off

8
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,735
with an introduction section

9
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:17,352
including this overview,

10
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:20,543
a discussion of Python 2 versus Python 3,

11
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:23,044
and a lecture on how best to approach this course

12
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,751
to maximise your benefits from taking this course.

13
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,206
After that, we'll get started with the Python Setup section.

17
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,448
You'll get access to additional learning resources online,

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,084
and then we'll have a brief overview on Git and GitHub.

19
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,614
Next, we start with the live code sections.

20
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,513
We'll learn about objects and data structure basics

21
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:53,550
including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries,

22

23
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,632
all in Python.

24
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:59,687
After each of these individual lectures,

25
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:02,316
there's quizzes to test your understanding.

26
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:05,018
And at the end of this section, there's an assessment test

27
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,356
so you can check your knowledge

28
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:09,065
on each of these topics.

29
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,428
Afterwards, we'll go to the section on Comparison Operators.

30
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,067
We'll learn about both basic operators

31
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,152
and chained comparison operators,

32
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,307
with this section ending with a quiz

33
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:21,279
to also test your understanding.

34
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,372
Then, we'll move onto Python statements

35
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:26,109
including if statements, for loops, while loops,

36
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,528

37
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:29,861
all in Python.

38
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,409
With an assessment test at the end

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,358
to test your understanding.

40
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,866
Next, we'll learn about methods and functions.

41
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,754
What they are, how to create them.

42
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,556
We'll also learn about Lambda expressions,

43
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,139

44
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,225
and scope in Python.

45
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:45,801
We'll top it off with a homework assignment

46
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,215
to test your understanding about methods and functions.

47
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:52,449
Then, you'll have your first milestone project

48
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:56,413
where you will create a game with Python.

49
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:59,667
Then, we'll move on to objected oriented programming

50
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,043
where we will learn about objects,

51
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,866

all in Python.

53
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:06,895
Then you'll get a homework assignment

54
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,145
to test your understanding.

55
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,099
After that,

56
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,950
we'll learn about errors and exception handling in Python

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,235
including what errors are,

58
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,190
what exceptions are,

59
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,356
and how to use try, accept, and finally

60
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,520
to handle errors and exceptions.

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,812
Then, we'll top it off with a test

62
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,181
to test your knowledge and your understanding

63
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,931
so far in the course.

64
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,829
Then, you'll come up with your second milestone project

65
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,081
where you're going to create a more complex game

66
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,248
all in Python.

67
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:38,960
Afterwards we'll learn about Modules and Packages in Python.

68
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800

70
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,761
and we'll explore the Python Ecosystem in general.

71
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,022
Then we'll move on to built-in functions in Python

72
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:51,857
such as map, reduce, filter, zip, enumerate,

73
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:55,315
all and any, and even how to deal with complex numbers.

74
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:56,307
At the end of this section,

75
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,363
we'll have a final assessment test

76
00:02:58,363 --> 00:02:59,779
where you can test your understanding

77
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,696
for built-in functions.

78
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,517
Next, we'll learn about decorators in Python.

79

including iteration versus generation discussions,

82
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,038
how to create generators, and a homework assignment

83
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:21,205
again, to test your knowledge about Python Generators.

84
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,178
After that, we'll put together everything you've learned

85
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:27,263
in a final capstone project.

86
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,392
But that's not all.

87
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,349
There's advanced bonus content,

88
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,508
including an entire section about Advanced Python Modules,

89
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,418
and advanced Python object and data structures,

90
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:38,288
so you can level up your knowledge.

91
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,923
There's new content regularly added to this section

92
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,923
with dozens of lectures.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,308
You'll also get access to community forums,

94

and dedicated help from me, your instructor.

95
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,357
So, that's the entire course curriculum overview,

96
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,152
so let's go ahead and get started with the course.
