00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,790
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,910
I wanted to take just a little bit of time to quickly discuss choosing Python 2 versus choosing Python

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,940
3.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,160
It used to be that if you are a beginner and you were just learning Python it was actually a pretty

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,430
difficult decision to choose Python to versus Python 3 because many companies still had legacy Python

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,610
to code to be maintain.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,950
However Python too was going to stop receiving security updates in the year 2020 and this course was

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,610
initially released teaching both versions of Python.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,960
We taught both Python to Python 3 and the versions were similar enough that it was easy to learn both

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,070
simultaneously and technically it still is.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,330
However now every major external Python package has been updated to support Python 3.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,250
Basically 99 percent of the top 300 packages of Python that are external packages you can download fully

13
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,820
support Python 3 and some of them are even moving towards being exclusively for Python 3.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,630
And these are packages such as Gengel for web development who will later in the future stop supporting

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,680
Python to because of this.

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,090
Now the course will focus solely on Python 3 and all the code all the notebooks and all the videos have

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,800
been updated to just focus purely on Python 3.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,590
Now if need be going back to Python 2 syntax is a very easy jump.

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,330
Once you know Python 3 so you can go through this course learn the entirety of Python 3 the ins and

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,740
outs of the Python programming language and in case you get a job somewhere where they still have Python

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,990
2 legacy code.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,070
Don't worry you're not going to be completely lost.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,290
The languages are very very similar.

24
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,340
The versions of the languages are similar so you can easily jump from one to the other and I always

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,800
like to say that if you know Python 3 you basically already know Python too.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,160
You just need to learn a couple of syntax changes in Python 3.

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,350
Really is the future of Python so that's where we focus on it for this course.

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,090
So just the short really quick summary based on three really is the future of Python.

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,260
So we're going to be using Python 3 exclusively for this course.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,610
Now the old notebooks are available in case you need some Python to information.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,430
But we're going to go ahead and get started by installing Python 3 and will be using Python 3 for the

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,480
rest of this course.

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,780
You have those old notebooks in case for some reason you need to reference legacy code.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,390
Thanks and we'll see at the next lecture where we begin installing Python.
